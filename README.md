# General preface

*Joseph Leopold Edler von Eybler: Sacred Music* (JLE:SM) is an edition project that will ultimately make all of Eybler’s church music works available in modern editions.



## Biography

Joseph Eybler, a later representative of Viennese Classicism, was born on 8 February 1765 in Schwechat as the fifth of six children of the local choirmaster and school teacher. He received his first music lessons at an early age from his father, a childhood friend of Michael Haydn, and at the age of six he impressed the court official Joseph Seitz so much at a piano concert that he got him a place at the Vienna city seminary of St. Stephan. In this seminar he was taught singing, playing instruments and basso continuo. He also received composition lessons from Johann Georg Albrechtsberger from 1777 to 1779.

After the seminary was closed under Joseph II in 1782, Eybler began studying law, but soon had to give it up and earn his living as a musician. He received support from, among others, his distant relative Joseph Haydn, with whom he was friends and who recommended his compositions for publication. He also developed a close friendship with Mozart, who entrusted him with choir and soloist rehearsals for the opera *Così fan tutte*. However, the bad experiences there convinced Eybler to devote himself entirely to church and chamber music after his only opera *Das Zauberschwert* (1790). After Mozart's early death, Eybler was commissioned by his widow Constanze to complete the Requiem, but Eybler ultimately found himself unable to do so.

From 1792, Eybler succeeded Albrechtsberger as choir director of the Carmelites, and from 1794 to 1824 also at the Schottenstift. Through several house concerts for the imperial family, Eybler won the favor of Empress Maria Theresa, so that in 1801/1802 he was appointed imperial teacher of music and had to teach the archdukes and archduchesses. In 1803, he composed his double-choir *Requiem in C minor* on commission from the Empress. In 1804 he was appointed vice-court conductor under Antonio Salieri. In 1806, Eybler married the Empress's valet, Theresia Müller; one of their two children died at the age of two. The oratorio *Die vier letzten Dinge* was commissioned by the Emperor in 1810 (its libretto of which was originally intended for Joseph Haydn).

When Salieri became seriously ill in 1823, Eybler took over the direction of the court music. After Salieri's retirement, he was officially appointed the first court conductor on 6 June 1824, and thus led the court music ensemble, which consisted of around 50 orchestra musicians and choir singers. During a Mozart requiem in February 1833, Eybler suffered a stroke, which forced him to withdraw further and further from the court music. Eybler's elevation to the nobility, which had long been requested, finally took place in 1835. On 24 July 1846, Eybler passed away in the Schottenhof in Vienna and was buried in Außer-Währing, but his remains were later transferred to Schwechat.

Eybler's musical style, which shows a thorough knowledge of composition, is primarily influenced by courtly tradition and by the elder masters such as Mozart or the Haydn brothers. The vocal parts are relatively simple, but the orchestral parts are often technically demanding, with all instruments being given equal status. Eybler's work and talent were highly appreciated during his lifetime, which is reflected not least in numerous extremely positive recommendations, including from Haydn, Mozart and Albrechtsberger. Despite his great fame, Eybler was increasingly forgotten over time.

## Editorial guidelines

In general, JLE:SM follows the [editorial guidelines](https://edition.esser-skala.at/about/editorial-guidelines/) for the Edition Esser-Skala. Some peculiarities for editione Eybler's works are highlighted below:

- The viola staff is – as in most autograph scores – titled “Viole” (plural).
- For the same reason, the bass group staff is titled “Organo, Violoncello e Bassi”.
- Eybler's bass figures occasionally contain the figure 5 with a roof. This figure indicates a diminished triad that should not be played as a sixth-fifth chord.
- If there are many differences between violone and organ, they are notated on two staffs in the full score.
- In the timpani, trill spans on a single note are converted to trill signs.
- In the autographs, where there are several instruments per staff, a separate clef is written for each instrument at the beginning of the staff. Here, only a single clef is printed.
