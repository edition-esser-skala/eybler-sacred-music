  –   & –    & An in-depth critical report is available in Reinhold
               Kainhofer’s edition of the work (Edition Kainhofer, 2011). \\
  –   & –    & There exist three versios of the work:
               Initially, it comprised 143 bars (Eybler also wrote down
               this number below the final bar line). For the second version
               (used as template for \B1), Eybler cancelled 17 bars following
               bar 72. (Here, these bars are reproduced as appendix).
               Concomitantly, he crossed out the bar count “143”
               and replaced it by “126”. In the third version
               (used as template for \C1 and \C2), Eybler also cancelled
               bars 80–81 and replaced the bar count by “124”.
               (Here, these bars are indicated by vide marks.)
               The cor parts in \A2 also comprise 124~bars,
               and there are no cancellations. \\
  –   & cor  & The title page of \D1 (but no other source) states
               that either two trombones or two horns should play. \\
  1   & –    & The addition “con moto” to the tempo indication appears
               in \A1 above the system, \A2, and \C1,
               but not in \A1 below the system, \B1, and \C2.
               Since “con moto” is written in the same ink
               as the bar count “124” in \A1, Eybler may have added it
               when revising the work for the third version. \\
