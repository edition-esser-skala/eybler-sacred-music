  – & – & The setting of the first verse (\textit{Lauda Sion})
          is based on the \textit{Alleluia} movement of HerEy 38.
          It likely has been arranged by a different hand.
          A total of 65 performance dates (as recorded on the envelope of \B1)
          from 1833 to 1906 testify to its popularity;
          the work was not performed only in the years 1860, 1877, 1879f,
          1883–1886, and 1897.
          \B1 also contains settings for three further verses of the hymn
          (\textit{Ecce panis Angelorum}, \textit{In figuris praesignatur},
          and \textit{Bone Pastor, panis vere}), which are likely not by Eybler. \\
