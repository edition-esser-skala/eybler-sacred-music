  – & – & Eybler reworked the two movements of this work into the offertory \textit{Summe Deus} (HerEy 90, 1818) and the gradual \textit{Te summe Jesu} (HerEy 49, 1809), respectively. To this end, he changed the scoring of the first movement. In the second movement, Eybler introduced the following major changes: (1) He replaced bars 232–234, 257f, and 278–291 with 11, 8, and 36 bars, respectively, thereby extending the movement from 79 to 115 bars. (2) He set different lyrics to the music. (3) He added parts for two bassoons. \\

lyrics:
  Haec est dies
  qua candidae instar columbae
  spiritus Theresiae
  ad sacra templa caelitum se transtulit.

  Sponsique voces audiit:
  Veni soror de vertice carmeli,
  ad agni nuptias veni,
  ad gloriae coronam veni.

  Te sponse Jesu,
  te sponse virginum
  beati ordines adorent
  et nuptiali cantico laudent
  per cuncta saecula.

  (Cantus Index a01576)
