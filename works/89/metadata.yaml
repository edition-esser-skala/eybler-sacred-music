  – & –   & Eybler reworked the two movements of this work into
            the offertory \textit{Summe Deus} (HerEy 90, 1818) and
            the gradual \textit{Te summe Jesu} (HerEy 49, 1809), respectively.
            To this end, he changed the lyrics and introduced several major
            changes (drafts of which also appear in \A1).
            Revision of first movement to HerEy~90:
            (1) Eybler deleted bars 61f and 91, replaced bars 96f with
            one new bar, and deleted bars~157f and 180–185,
            thereby shortening the movement from 212 to 200 bars.
            (2) He added parts for two bassoons and a mixed chorus.
            (3) He replaced the solo viola d’amore with a solo violin.
            Revision of second movement to HerEy~49:
            (1) Eybler replaced bars 232–234, 257f, and 278–291 with
            11, 8, and 36 bars, respectively, thereby extending
            the movement from 79 to 115 bars.
            (2) He added parts for two bassoons. \\

lyrics:
  Haec est dies\\
  qua candidae instar columbae\\
  spiritus Theresiae\\
  ad sacra templa caelitum se transtulit.\\[1ex]
  Sponsique voces audiit:\\
  Veni soror de vertice carmeli,\\
  ad agni nuptias veni,\\
  ad gloriae coronam veni.\\[1ex]
  Te sponse Jesu,\\
  te sponse virginum\\
  beati ordines adorent\\
  et nuptiali cantico laudent\\
  per cuncta saecula.\\[1ex]
